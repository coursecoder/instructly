# Retrospective Process Checklist

**Purpose:** To ensure comprehensive and effective retrospective analysis of development issues, with focus on process improvement and learning rather than blame assignment.

**Instructions:** Review each item with the retrospective facilitator and stakeholders. Mark `[x]` for completed/confirmed, `[N/A]` if not applicable, or add notes for discussion points.

## 1. Retrospective Setup & Preparation

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - RETROSPECTIVE FACILITATION

A retrospective is a learning opportunity, not a blame session. The goal is to:

1. Understand what happened and why
2. Identify systemic improvements
3. Create actionable prevention strategies
4. Build team learning and resilience

Before proceeding, understand:
- This is for significant issues that represent learning opportunities
- Focus on process and system improvements, not individual performance
- Psychological safety is critical for honest discussion
- Evidence-based analysis over assumptions
- Concrete actions over abstract recommendations

Required context:
- The triggering issue or incident
- Timeline of events and decision points
- Relevant team members and stakeholders
- Access to logs, documents, and artifacts
- Understanding of existing processes and standards

APPROACH:
This is a collaborative learning process. Work through each section systematically, ensuring all perspectives are heard and documented. Focus on future prevention while acknowledging current realities.
