# Development Retrospective Task

## Purpose

To conduct a structured analysis of critical development issues that were missed in the development process, identify root causes, and create actionable process improvements to prevent similar issues in the future. This task provides a framework for systematic retrospective analysis that goes beyond blame to focus on process enhancement and team learning.

## Scope

This retrospective framework can be applied to:
- Critical TypeScript compilation failures that reached production/merge
- Security vulnerabilities discovered late in development
- Performance issues not caught during development
- Architecture decisions that created technical debt
- Testing gaps that allowed bugs to reach users
- Integration failures between components/services

## SEQUENTIAL Task Execution

### 1. Retrospective Setup & Context Gathering

#### 1.1 Define the Issue Scope
- [ ] **Clearly identify the specific issue(s)** being retrospectively analyzed
- [ ] **Document the impact:** What went wrong? When was it discovered? What was the business/technical impact?
- [ ] **Establish timeline:** When did the issue originate? When should it have been caught? When was it actually discovered?
- [ ] **Gather stakeholders:** Identify all team members who were involved in the affected development cycle

#### 1.2 Collect Evidence and Artifacts
- [ ] **Review commit history** related to the affected areas
- [ ] **Examine pull request reviews** and approval processes
- [ ] **Analyze CI/CD pipeline logs** and test results from the relevant timeframe
- [ ] **Review story completion records** from affected development cycles
- [ ] **Document existing process documents** that should have prevented the issue

### 2. Timeline and Process Analysis

#### 2.1 Create Detailed Timeline
- [ ] **Map the development timeline** from story creation to issue discovery
- [ ] **Identify decision points** where the issue could have been prevented or caught
- [ ] **Document which processes were followed** vs. which were skipped or inadequate
- [ ] **Note any pressure points** (deadlines, resource constraints, competing priorities)

#### 2.2 Analyze Process Adherence
- [ ] **Review story creation process:** Were requirements clear? Was technical context adequate?
- [ ] **Examine development workflow:** Were coding standards followed? Was code review thorough?
- [ ] **Evaluate testing coverage:** Were appropriate tests written and executed?
- [ ] **Assess integration points:** Were component interfaces properly validated?

### 3. Root Cause Analysis (5 Whys Method)

- [ ] Analyze code review processes

#### 3.3 Third Level Analysis - Process Gaps
**Why didn't our processes prevent this?** (Third Why)
- [ ] Identify gaps in story preparation and technical context
- [ ] Review adequacy of architecture documentation
- [ ] Examine developer onboarding and knowledge sharing

#### 3.4 Fourth Level Analysis - Systemic Issues
**Why do these process gaps exist?** (Fourth Why)
- [ ] Analyze team workload and time pressures
- [ ] Review tool adequacy and automation gaps
- [ ] Examine communication patterns and knowledge silos

#### 3.5 Fifth Level Analysis - Organizational Factors
**Why haven't we addressed these systemic issues?** (Fifth Why)
- [ ] Review prioritization of technical debt and process improvement
- [ ] Analyze resource allocation for quality processes
- [ ] Examine feedback loops and continuous improvement culture
