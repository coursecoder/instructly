# TypeScript Quality Guidelines and Prevention Strategies

## Purpose

This document provides comprehensive guidelines for preventing TypeScript-related issues in development projects, based on retrospective analysis of common failure patterns and industry best practices.

## Critical Prevention Strategies

### 1. Mandatory Type Checking Integration

#### Development Environment
- **Real-time type checking**: Configure IDEs/editors for immediate TypeScript feedback
- **Save-on-type validation**: Automatic type checking on file save
- **Error highlighting**: Visual indicators for type errors in development environment
- **Quick fixes**: IDE integration for common type error resolutions

#### Git Workflow Integration
```bash
# Pre-commit hook example
#!/bin/sh
npm run type-check
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "TypeScript type checking failed. Fix errors before committing."
  exit 1
fi
```

#### CI/CD Pipeline Requirements
- **Mandatory type checking**: `npm run type-check` as a required CI/CD step
- **Zero tolerance**: Pipeline fails on any TypeScript compilation errors
- **Type coverage reporting**: Track and improve type coverage over time
- **Performance monitoring**: Track type checking performance and optimization

### 2. Story Preparation Type Safety Requirements

#### Technical Context Requirements
When creating stories involving TypeScript development, include:

- **Type Interface Specifications**: Define expected types and interfaces
- **API Contract Types**: Specify request/response types for API endpoints
- **Component Prop Types**: Define React component prop interfaces
- **State Management Types**: Specify store/context type definitions
- **Error Handling Types**: Define error types and handling patterns

#### Acceptance Criteria Additions
Standard TypeScript acceptance criteria to include:
- [ ] All new code passes TypeScript compilation without errors
- [ ] All new interfaces are properly typed (no `any` types without justification)
- [ ] API endpoints have proper request/response type definitions
- [ ] Component props are fully typed with proper interfaces
- [ ] Error handling includes proper type guards and validation

#### Story Template Enhancements
```markdown
## TypeScript Requirements
- **Type Safety Level**: [Strict | Standard | Legacy]
- **Interface Definitions**: [List required interfaces]
- **API Types**: [Specify API type requirements]
- **Component Types**: [Define component typing needs]
- **Error Types**: [Specify error handling types]

## Type Safety Validation
- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes with zero errors
- [ ] No use of `any` type without explicit justification
- [ ] All public APIs have proper type definitions
- [ ] Type coverage maintains or improves project baseline
```

### 3. Enhanced Definition of Done for TypeScript Projects

#### Mandatory Completion Criteria
- [ ] **TypeScript Compilation**: Code compiles without TypeScript errors
- [ ] **Type Coverage**: New code maintains or improves type coverage percentage
- [ ] **Interface Documentation**: All public interfaces documented with TSDoc
- [ ] **Type Testing**: Type-level tests written for complex types (when applicable)
- [ ] **No Any Types**: No `any` types without explicit justification in code comments

#### Code Review Requirements
- [ ] **Type Safety Review**: Reviewer verifies appropriate type usage
- [ ] **Interface Review**: Public interfaces reviewed for completeness and clarity
- [ ] **Type Complexity**: Complex types broken down or documented appropriately
- [ ] **Generic Usage**: Generic types used appropriately and not over-engineered
- [ ] **Migration Path**: Any type migrations have clear upgrade paths

### 4. Adapter Pattern and Technology Choice Guidelines

#### Decision Documentation Requirements
For any technology involving multiple adapter patterns (like tRPC, GraphQL, etc.):

1. **Architecture Decision Record (ADR)**:
   ```markdown
   # ADR: tRPC Adapter Pattern Choice
   
   ## Status
   Accepted
   
   ## Context
   Need to choose between Next.js adapter and fetch adapter for tRPC
   
   ## Decision
   Use Next.js adapter for API routes, fetch adapter for edge functions
   
   ## Consequences
   - Consistent with Next.js patterns
   - Better integration with Next.js middleware
   - Requires different type definitions for different contexts
   ```

2. **Type Definition Standards**:
   - Document expected types for each adapter pattern
   - Create type utility functions for common patterns
   - Establish naming conventions for different adapter contexts

3. **Implementation Guidelines**:
   - Provide code examples for each adapter pattern
   - Document when to use which adapter
   - Create templates for common adapter implementations

#### Technology Choice Validation
Before choosing libraries or frameworks with multiple adapter patterns:
- [ ] **Pattern Research**: Research all available adapter patterns
- [ ] **Type Compatibility**: Verify TypeScript type definitions are available
- [ ] **Team Knowledge**: Assess team familiarity with chosen patterns
- [ ] **Documentation**: Ensure adequate documentation exists
- [ ] **Migration Path**: Plan for potential future adapter changes

### 5. Code Review Type Safety Checklist

#### Pre-Review Automated Checks
- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes
- [ ] Type coverage report generated
- [ ] Linting rules for TypeScript pass
- [ ] No `any` types without justification comments

#### Manual Review Checklist
- [ ] **Type Appropriateness**: Types are specific and accurate
- [ ] **Interface Completeness**: All required properties defined
- [ ] **Generic Usage**: Generics used appropriately, not over-engineered
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Proper type guards and error type definitions
- [ ] **API Consistency**: Request/response types match API contracts
- [ ] **Component Types**: React components have proper prop types
- [ ] **Performance Impact**: Type definitions don't negatively impact build performance

#### Advanced Type Review
- [ ] **Type Inference**: Appropriate use of type inference vs explicit types
- [ ] **Union Types**: Proper use of union types for multiple valid values
- [ ] **Conditional Types**: Complex conditional types are well-documented
- [ ] **Mapped Types**: Utility types used appropriately for transformations
- [ ] **Type Guards**: Runtime type validation where necessary

### 6. TypeScript Configuration Standards

#### Strict Configuration Template
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "noImplicitReturns": true,
    "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true,
    "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true,
    "exactOptionalPropertyTypes": true,
    "noImplicitOverride": true,
    "allowUnusedLabels": false,
    "allowUnreachableCode": false,
    "skipLibCheck": false,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*", "tests/**/*"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "dist", "build"]
}
```

#### Project-Specific Configurations
- **Web Applications**: Enhanced DOM type checking
- **Node.js Services**: Server-specific type configurations
- **Libraries**: Strict type generation for public APIs
- **Monorepos**: Consistent configuration across packages

### 7. Testing Strategy for Type Safety

#### Type-Level Testing
```typescript
// Example type-level test
type AssertEqual<T, U> = T extends U ? (U extends T ? true : false) : false;

// Test API response type
type ApiResponseTest = AssertEqual<
  ApiResponse<User>,
  { data: User; success: boolean; error?: string }
>;
const apiResponseTest: ApiResponseTest = true; // Compile-time validation
```

#### Runtime Type Validation
- **Schema Validation**: Use libraries like Zod for runtime type checking
- **API Boundary Validation**: Validate types at system boundaries
- **User Input Validation**: Type-safe validation of user inputs
- **Configuration Validation**: Type-safe configuration loading

#### Integration Testing
- **Type Compatibility**: Test type compatibility across module boundaries
- **API Contract Testing**: Validate API types match implementation
- **Component Interface Testing**: Test React component prop interfaces
- **State Type Testing**: Validate state management type definitions

### 8. Continuous Improvement Strategies

#### Type Coverage Monitoring
- **Baseline Establishment**: Set initial type coverage percentage goals
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Gradually improve type coverage over time
- **Coverage Reporting**: Regular reports on type coverage progress
- **Regression Prevention**: Prevent type coverage from decreasing

#### Knowledge Sharing
- **TypeScript Champions**: Designate TypeScript experts on the team
- **Regular Training**: Monthly TypeScript knowledge sharing sessions
- **Best Practice Documentation**: Maintain living documentation of patterns
- **External Learning**: Conference attendance and community participation

#### Tool Evolution
- **IDE Configuration**: Regularly update development environment configurations
- **Linting Rules**: Evolve TypeScript linting rules based on team learnings
- **Build Optimization**: Continuously improve TypeScript build performance
- **Type Generation**: Automate type generation where possible

### 9. Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

#### Type Safety Anti-Patterns
- **Excessive `any` usage**: Using `any` as an escape hatch instead of proper typing
- **Type assertions without validation**: Using `as` without runtime validation
- **Ignoring compiler errors**: Suppressing errors instead of fixing them
- **Over-engineering types**: Creating unnecessarily complex type definitions
- **Inconsistent naming**: Using inconsistent patterns for similar types

#### Process Anti-Patterns
- **Optional type checking**: Making TypeScript validation optional in CI/CD
- **Post-development typing**: Adding types after functionality is complete
- **Isolated type decisions**: Making type choices without team discussion
- **Documentation lag**: Not updating type documentation with code changes
- **Legacy tolerance**: Accepting poor type safety in legacy code indefinitely
