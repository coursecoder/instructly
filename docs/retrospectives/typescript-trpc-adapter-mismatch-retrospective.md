# Retrospective Analysis: TypeScript tRPC Adapter Type Mismatch

## Issue Summary
- **Issue**: TypeScript compilation failure due to type mismatch between `Request` and `NextApiRequest` in tRPC handler
- **Impact**: Development workflow blocked, CI/CD pipeline failing, type safety compromised
- **Discovery Date**: August 18, 2025 (during type checking)
- **Origin Date**: Unknown - likely introduced during initial tRPC setup
- **Error**: `Type 'Request' is missing the following properties from type 'NextApiRequest': query, cookies, env, aborted, and 68 more.`

## Root Cause Analysis

### Immediate Cause
The tRPC handler function in `/home/coleens/dev/instructly/apps/api/src/functions/trpc/[trpc].ts` uses the wrong adapter configuration:
- File uses `fetchRequestHandler` with standard `Request` type
- Context creation function expects `CreateNextContextOptions` with `NextApiRequest`
- Type mismatch between fetch adapter and Next.js adapter context

### 5 Whys Analysis

1. **What happened?**
   - TypeScript compilation fails because `Request` type doesn't match expected `NextApiRequest` type in the tRPC context creation function

2. **Why did this type mismatch occur?**
   - The handler uses `fetchRequestHandler` (standard Web API) while the context function is typed for Next.js API routes (`CreateNextContextOptions`)
   - Mixed adapter patterns without proper type alignment

3. **Why wasn't this caught during development?**
   - TypeScript type checking may not have been run during initial development
   - Possible use of `any` types or type assertion workarounds during development
   - Missing or inadequate CI/CD type checking validation

4. **Why didn't our processes prevent this?**
   - No mandatory type checking in development workflow
   - Story templates may not have included proper type safety validation requirements
   - Code review process didn't catch the adapter/type mismatch

5. **Why haven't we addressed these systematic type safety gaps?**
   - TypeScript configuration and tooling may not be fully integrated into development workflow
   - Process prioritizes functionality over type safety
   - Missing comprehensive Definition of Done criteria for TypeScript projects

## Contributing Factors Analysis

### Technical Factors
- **Mixed adapter patterns**: Using fetch adapter handler with Next.js context types
- **Inadequate TypeScript configuration**: Type checking not enforced during development
- **Missing type safety validation**: No automated type checking in CI/CD pipeline
- **Inconsistent adapter choice**: Unclear whether to use Next.js or fetch adapters

### Process Factors
- **Insufficient story preparation**: Technical context didn't specify tRPC adapter requirements
- **Incomplete Definition of Done**: Type checking not included in completion criteria
- **Inadequate code review**: Type mismatches not caught during PR reviews
- **Missing type safety guidelines**: No clear standards for TypeScript type safety

### Human Factors
- **Knowledge gaps**: Potential unfamiliarity with tRPC adapter differences
- **Assumption risks**: Assuming type compatibility without verification
- **Context switching**: Possible confusion between different tRPC adapter patterns

## Impact Assessment

### Immediate Impact
- **Development workflow blocked**: Cannot complete type checking or builds
- **CI/CD pipeline failure**: Automated builds and deployments failing
- **Type safety compromised**: Runtime errors possible due to type mismatches
- **Development velocity reduced**: Time spent debugging type issues

### Broader Impact
- **Team confidence**: Reduced trust in TypeScript tooling and process
- **Technical debt**: Potential for more type safety issues throughout codebase
- **Code quality concerns**: Questions about other potential type mismatches
- **Process reliability**: Uncertainty about development workflow effectiveness
