| Wide | 1440px | - | Large desktop monitors and external displays (power user setups) |

### Adaptation Patterns

#### **Layout Changes:**
Desktop-first approach with sophisticated multi-panel layouts that collapse gracefully to single-column on smaller screens. Dashboard widgets maintain professional appearance while stacking vertically on tablets. Wide desktop layouts support advanced power user configurations with multiple content areas.

#### **Navigation Changes:**
Primary navigation transforms from horizontal tabs (desktop) to collapsible navigation drawer (tablet/mobile). Secondary navigation becomes slide-out panels with touch-friendly targets. Breadcrumb navigation remains visible but compresses intelligently on smaller screens while maintaining functionality.

#### **Content Priority:**
AI analysis results and methodology explanations remain prominent across all screen sizes. Detailed compliance reports maintain full functionality but may require horizontal scrolling on mobile. Stakeholder presentation mode specifically optimized for tablet viewing with larger touch targets and simplified interface.

#### **Interaction Changes:**
Touch-friendly 44px minimum tap targets on tablet and mobile devices. Hover states gracefully adapt to touch interactions with appropriate feedback. Keyboard shortcuts remain available and functional but may be de-emphasized in mobile interfaces. Drag-and-drop interactions adapt to touch gestures on tablets.

### Device-Specific Optimization

#### **Desktop/Wide (Primary Workflow):**
- Multi-panel layouts with configurable workspace arrangements
- Advanced keyboard shortcuts and power user features prominently available
- Detailed information density suitable for complex lesson planning
- Multiple simultaneous task support with panel management

#### **Tablet (Stakeholder Presentations):**
- Clean, presentation-optimized layouts that enhance professional credibility
- Touch-optimized review and approval workflows
- Simplified navigation that doesn't detract from content focus
- Annotation and commenting tools designed for touch interaction

#### **Mobile (Basic Review):**
- Essential functionality only - project status, basic content review
- Simplified navigation prioritizing most common tasks
- Notification management and basic approval workflows
- Optimized for quick check-ins rather than detailed work

This responsive strategy ensures professional credibility is maintained across all devices while acknowledging the workflow realities of instructional design work and stakeholder presentations.

## Animation & Micro-interactions

### Motion Principles

**Purposeful Movement:** Every animation serves a functional purpose - providing feedback, showing relationships, or guiding attention. No decorative animations that could undermine professional credibility during stakeholder presentations.

**Subtle Professional Polish:** Smooth, refined transitions that feel sophisticated and intentional, similar to high-end business software (Tableau, Figma) rather than consumer apps. Motion enhances the enterprise aesthetic without drawing attention to itself.

**Performance Consciousness:** All animations respect the "prefers-reduced-motion" accessibility setting and degrade gracefully on lower-performance devices. Essential functionality remains available without animation dependencies.

**Contextual Appropriateness:** Motion intensity adapts to context - minimal animations during stakeholder presentation modes, more engaging micro-interactions during daily workflow tasks to enhance usability.

### Key Animations

- **AI Processing Indicator:** Subtle pulse animation with progress indication during content analysis, building confidence in AI processing (Duration: Variable, Easing: ease-in-out)
- **Classification Result Reveal:** Smooth fade-in with slight scale for AI recommendations, emphasizing the collaborative nature of AI suggestions (Duration: 300ms, Easing: ease-out)
- **Panel Transitions:** Slide animations for progressive disclosure and multi-panel layouts, maintaining spatial relationships (Duration: 250ms, Easing: ease-in-out)
- **Success State Confirmations:** Gentle scale and color transition for completed tasks and approvals, reinforcing positive outcomes (Duration: 400ms, Easing: ease-out)
- **Loading State Transitions:** Professional skeleton screen animations and smooth content replacement that maintain layout stability (Duration: 200ms, Easing: ease-in-out)
- **Hover State Feedback:** Subtle scale and shadow changes for interactive elements, providing clear interaction affordances (Duration: 150ms, Easing: ease-out)
- **Dashboard Widget Updates:** Smooth data transitions and chart animations for metric updates, emphasizing data-driven insights (Duration: 500ms, Easing: ease-in-out)
- **Stakeholder Mode Transition:** Clean fade between working and presentation views, maintaining professional focus (Duration: 300ms, Easing: ease-in-out)

### Professional Motion Guidelines

**Enterprise-Appropriate Timing:** All animations use conservative timing that feels deliberate rather than playful. Durations stay within 150-500ms range for optimal perceived performance while maintaining sophistication.

**Consistent Easing:** Primary use of ease-in-out and ease-out curves that feel natural and professional. Avoid bounce or elastic easing that might appear unprofessional in enterprise contexts.

**Reduced Motion Compliance:** All animations have meaningful alternatives for users with motion sensitivity. Essential feedback is communicated through color, text, or icon changes when motion is disabled.

**Cross-Context Adaptation:** Animations automatically reduce in intensity during stakeholder presentation modes and screen sharing scenarios to maintain professional focus on content rather than interface.

## Performance Considerations

### Performance Goals

- **Page Load:** Initial page load under 2 seconds on desktop, under 3 seconds on mobile with 3G connection
- **Interaction Response:** AI analysis results displayed within 3 seconds (per PRD requirement) with immediate feedback
- **Animation FPS:** Maintain 60fps for all animations and interactions, graceful degradation on lower-performance devices

### Design Strategies

#### **AI Response Optimization:**
Implement intelligent caching strategies for AI responses with progressive loading architecture. Show classification confidence scores immediately while detailed rationale loads progressively on demand. Use professional skeleton screens during AI processing to maintain perceived performance while respecting the critical 3-second business requirement.

#### **Progressive Enhancement:**
Core functionality and content load first with advanced features enhanced progressively based on device capabilities and network conditions. Stakeholder presentation modes prioritize content delivery and visual polish over interactive features. Critical workflows (lesson creation, compliance checking) receive priority resource allocation.

#### **Asset Optimization:**
Modern image formats (WebP, AVIF) with responsive loading based on device capabilities and screen size. Component-based code splitting ensures only necessary interface elements are downloaded per user workflow. Font loading optimization with system font fallbacks to prevent layout shifts that could impact professional appearance.

#### **Enterprise Scalability Design:**
Interface architecture designed to support 1000+ concurrent users through efficient component rendering and intelligent data fetching. Dashboard widgets load independently to prevent performance bottlenecks. Real-time features (notifications, collaboration) use efficient WebSocket connections with graceful degradation.

### Performance-UX Integration

#### **Professional Credibility Maintenance:**
Performance optimizations never compromise the professional aesthetic or enterprise credibility. Loading states use sophisticated skeleton screens that maintain layout structure. Error states provide clear, professional messaging with actionable recovery options.

#### **Cost-Performance Balance:**
AI interaction design optimized to maintain <30% revenue cost ratio through intelligent caching, progressive disclosure of detailed analysis, and efficient prompt engineering. Performance improvements directly support business model sustainability.

#### **Cross-Device Performance Strategy:**
Desktop interfaces can support rich, multi-panel layouts with advanced features. Tablet presentation modes optimize for smooth scrolling and touch responsiveness. Mobile interfaces prioritize essential functionality with streamlined performance profiles.

This performance strategy ensures that sophisticated AI capabilities and professional interface polish don't compromise the speed and reliability required for enterprise adoption and daily workflow efficiency.

- Trend indicator: `text-green-600` (positive) or `text-red-600` (negative)
- Status badges: `bg-green-100 text-green-800` for success states
- Animation duration: 150-300ms with ease-out timing

**STRICT SCOPE:**
Create only the DashboardWidget component with supporting TypeScript interfaces. Include proper accessibility attributes (ARIA labels, roles).

#### Stakeholder Presentation Interface
```
**HIGH-LEVEL GOAL:**
Create a clean, presentation-optimized interface component that transitions from working view to stakeholder-ready presentation mode.

**DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS:**
1. Create `StakeholderPresentation.tsx` component with mode switching
2. Design clean, minimal layout that prioritizes content over interface elements
3. Include presentation header with lesson title, methodology summary, and compliance status
4. Create content sections with proper typography hierarchy and spacing
5. Add professional footer with generated timestamp and methodology attribution
6. Implement smooth transition animations between working and presentation modes
7. Include comment and approval workflow elements (when in review mode)
8. Add print-friendly styling with proper page breaks
9. Ensure all text meets high contrast requirements for projection/screen sharing
10. Include subtle branding elements that enhance rather than distract

**CODE EXAMPLES & CONSTRAINTS:**
- Presentation layout: `max-w-4xl mx-auto bg-white min-h-screen`
- Typography: Use Manrope for headings, Inter for body text
- Section spacing: `space-y-8` for major sections, `space-y-4` for subsections
- Professional margins: `px-8 py-12` for main content area
- Print styles: `@media print` with `break-inside-avoid` for sections
- Compliance badge: `inline-flex items-center px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm font-medium bg-green-100 text-green-800`

**STRICT SCOPE:**
Create only the presentation component with mode switching logic. Include proper semantic HTML structure (main, section, article elements).

### Enterprise Design Guidelines for AI Generation

#### Mobile-First Approach:
1. Start with single-column mobile layout (320px-767px)
2. Stack all elements vertically with consistent spacing
3. Use full-width buttons and form elements
4. Then describe tablet adaptations (768px-1023px) with two-column layouts
5. Finally, desktop enhancements (1024px+) with multi-panel configurations

#### Professional Credibility Requirements:
- All loading states must use sophisticated skeleton screens, not spinners
- Error messages should be professional and actionable, never technical jargon
- Success states should feel accomplished, not playful
- Hover effects should be subtle scaling (1.02x max) with soft shadows
- Focus indicators must be highly visible with 2px borders minimum

**Important:** All AI-generated code requires careful human review for accessibility compliance, performance optimization, and integration testing with existing codebase.
