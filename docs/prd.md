# AI-Powered Instructional Design Platform Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Transform instructional design from craft-based practice to evidence-based profession with AI-powered instructional design framework classification
- Eliminate "blank page syndrome" by providing research-backed starting points that reduce lesson planning time from 40-60% research to <20%
- Establish professional credibility for instructional designers through AI-generated diagrams, activities, and automated documentation systems
- Ensure enterprise accessibility compliance (Section 508/WCAG 2.1) with 90%+ automated accuracy, eliminating legal risk and manual remediation
- Achieve market validation with 100 paying customers and $500K ARR within 12 months, targeting sales enablement teams as premium entry segment
- Create industry-standard platform recognized by professional organizations (ATD, ISPI) for evidence-based instructional design practices

### Background Context

Corporate instructional designers face a triple challenge that undermines professional effectiveness: rapid topic mastery pressure (2-3 week deadlines for complex technical content), blank page syndrome requiring extensive manual research, and a professional credibility gap with stakeholders who possess superior subject matter expertise. This results in 40-60% of project time being wasted on basic research rather than applying instructional design expertise, leading to superficial content that fails technical audiences and positioning IDs as "PowerPoint creators" rather than learning experience architects.

The convergence of AI adoption acceleration (100M+ ChatGPT users), mandatory accessibility compliance pressure, and a 15+ year professional recognition crisis creates urgent market opportunity. Existing solutions fall short: generic AI tools lack pedagogical frameworks, traditional ID tools provide no research foundation, and manual processes cannot scale with enterprise demands. The proposed AI-powered platform addresses this by combining intelligent topic analysis using established instructional design frameworks, professional credibility generation through sophisticated outputs, and built-in compliance automation—transforming instructional design into a legitimate, evidence-based profession similar to how standardized tools legitimized accounting.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

Professional, enterprise-grade interface that positions instructional designers as credible experts rather than creative hobbyists. The platform should feel like sophisticated business intelligence software (think Tableau or Salesforce) rather than consumer design tools, emphasizing data-driven decision making and evidence-based methodology. Clean, accessible design that works seamlessly for both quick lesson planning sessions and detailed stakeholder presentations.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Guided Workflow Approach:** Step-by-step wizard-style interface for lesson creation that demonstrates professional methodology while reducing cognitive load
- **Dashboard-Centric Design:** Central hub showing project status, compliance scores, and professional metrics that can be shared with stakeholders
- **Evidence-Based Transparency:** Every AI recommendation includes visible rationale and instructional design framework justification to build user confidence and stakeholder credibility

### Core Screens and Views

- Project Dashboard (overview of all lesson plans, compliance status, recent activity)
- Topic Analysis Input & Results (instructional design framework classification with detailed explanations)
- Lesson Plan Builder (structured creation interface with real-time accessibility checking)
- Professional Documentation Viewer (generated ID Chart with methodology explanations)
- Stakeholder Sharing Interface (clean, presentation-ready views of completed work)
- Compliance Audit Reports (detailed accessibility documentation for enterprise requirements)

### Accessibility: WCAG AA

Enterprise accessibility compliance is a core business requirement, not just a nice-to-have. The platform itself must demonstrate the accessibility standards it helps users achieve.

### Branding

Professional, credible, evidence-based aesthetic that elevates instructional design as a legitimate business discipline. The Instructly brand combines the authority of "instruct" with modern SaaS positioning through the "-ly" suffix, creating a name that works in enterprise boardrooms while maintaining tech-forward appeal. Visual design should emphasize data visualization elements, clean typography, and subtle use of instructional design framework colors to reinforce pedagogical credibility.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Primary focus on desktop/laptop for detailed lesson planning work, with tablet support for stakeholder presentations and reviews. Mobile support secondary priority as this is professional workflow software.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

Given bootstrap/self-funded constraints and need for rapid iteration, a monorepo approach enables shared code, unified testing, and simplified deployment while maintaining separation between frontend, backend, and AI processing modules.

### Service Architecture

Microservices within Monorepo - Hybrid approach balancing development efficiency with scalability needs. Core services include: AI Processing Engine, Accessibility Compliance Checker, User Management, Content Generation, and LMS Integration APIs. This allows independent scaling of AI-intensive components while maintaining development simplicity.

### Testing Requirements

Unit + Integration - Focus on unit tests for AI prompt engineering and integration tests for accessibility compliance accuracy. Given the 90% compliance requirement, automated testing of WCAG validation is critical. Manual testing convenience methods needed for stakeholder demonstration scenarios.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

- **Frontend Technology:** React with TypeScript for robust accessibility support required for WCAG AA compliance, extensive component libraries for professional UI, and strong TypeScript integration for maintainable enterprise code
- **Backend Technology:** Node.js with Express/Fastify for AI integration requirements, excellent API performance, and rapid development iteration
- **Database Strategy:** PostgreSQL for structured lesson plan data and audit trails + Redis for caching AI responses (critical for 30% cost constraint) and user sessions
- **AI Infrastructure:** OpenAI GPT-5 with intelligent caching, GPT-3.5-turbo for classification tasks, aggressive caching strategy and prompt optimization to maintain <30% cost ratio
- **Hosting & Deployment:** AWS with auto-scaling for cloud-native architecture supporting 1000+ concurrent users, SOC 2 compliance requirements, and global CDN for performance
- **Cost Control Focus:** Every technical choice optimized for sustainable unit economics given AI token constraints
- **Enterprise Compliance:** Architecture supports SOC 2, GDPR, and accessibility audit requirements from foundation
- **AI Optimization:** Multi-model strategy and caching essential for meeting both performance and cost requirements
