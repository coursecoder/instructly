# Story 5.1: Authentication System Enablement & Security Hardening

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** platform administrator,
**I want** proper JWT authentication and security controls enabled in production,
**so that** user access is secure and the platform is production-ready with proper authorization.

## Context & Problem Statement
**Current Critical Issues (from Code Review):**
- **BLOCKING**: Auth router disabled in production (`apps/api/src/trpc/routers/index.ts:3`)
- **SECURITY RISK**: Placeholder JWT validation with hardcoded demo users
- **INCOMPLETE**: Missing proper session management and security middleware
- **PRODUCTION BLOCKER**: Authentication system prevents deployment

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Enable Production Authentication**: Remove comment and enable auth router in main tRPC router configuration
2. **Implement Proper JWT Validation**: Replace placeholder auth service with full Supabase Auth integration with signature verification
3. **Remove Demo User Dependencies**: Eliminate hardcoded demo user IDs and implement proper user context throughout application
4. **Add Security Middleware**: Implement rate limiting, audit logging, and comprehensive session management
5. **Fix Authentication Context**: Ensure all protected endpoints properly validate user authentication
6. **Environment Security**: Secure all authentication-related environment variables for production deployment
7. **Session Management**: Add proper JWT refresh token handling and session timeout management
8. **Audit & Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive logging for all authentication events
9. **Testing Validation**: Ensure all authentication tests pass and cover security edge cases
10. **Documentation Update**: Update deployment and security documentation with production authentication setup

## Dev Notes

### Current Implementation Analysis
**From Code Review Findings:**
- Story 1.2 implemented comprehensive authentication foundation but disabled for deployment
- All authentication infrastructure exists but is commented out or using stubs
- Test suite has authentication coverage but some tests failing due to configuration issues

### Critical File Locations
**Primary Blocker Files:**
- `apps/api/src/trpc/routers/index.ts:3` - Auth router commented out
- `apps/api/src/services/auth.ts` - Using stub implementation instead of full service
- `apps/api/src/trpc/index.ts` - Placeholder JWT validation context

**Authentication Infrastructure Files:**
- `apps/api/src/trpc/routers/auth.ts` - Complete auth router (ready to enable)
- `apps/web/src/stores/auth.ts` - Frontend auth store (functional)
- `apps/api/src/middleware/auth.ts` - Auth middleware (needs production config)

### Environment Variables Audit
**Current Environment Issues:**
```bash
# Server-side only (SECURE)
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=xxx
OPENAI_API_KEY=xxx

# Client-side exposure risk (NEEDS AUDIT)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=xxx
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=xxx
```

### Authentication Flow Requirements
**Production Authentication Flow:**
1. User logs in via `/auth/login` → Supabase Auth → JWT token
2. tRPC procedures check auth context → Validate JWT → Allow/deny access
3. Frontend stores auth state → Auto-refresh tokens → Handle session timeout
4. Protected routes require valid user context → Redirect to login if unauthorized

### Testing Strategy
**Authentication Test Categories:**
- **Unit Tests**: JWT validation, auth middleware, token handling
- **Integration Tests**: Complete login/logout flows, session management
- **Security Tests**: Rate limiting, brute force protection, token tampering
- **Edge Cases**: Expired tokens, invalid signatures, missing auth headers

### Technical Constraints
**Production Security Requirements:**
- JWT tokens must be validated on every protected request
- Rate limiting must prevent brute force attacks
- All authentication events must be logged for audit compliance
- Session management must handle token refresh and timeout scenarios
- Environment variables must be properly secured and validated

### Risk Assessment
**High Risk Areas:**
- **Authentication Bypass**: Disabled auth router allows unauthorized access
- **Token Security**: Placeholder validation accepts any token format
- **Session Management**: No proper timeout or refresh token handling
- **Audit Trail**: No logging of authentication events for security monitoring

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Enable authentication step-by-step with comprehensive testing
- Implement comprehensive logging before enabling production authentication
- Add monitoring and alerting for authentication failures
- Create rollback procedures for authentication deployment issues

### Success Metrics
**Security Metrics:**
- Zero authentication bypass vulnerabilities
- 100% test coverage for authentication edge cases
- Mean time to authentication < 200ms
- Audit log coverage for 100% of authentication events

**Operational Metrics:**
- Zero production deployment failures related to authentication
- Authentication service uptime > 99.9%
- Mean time to resolve authentication issues < 5 minutes
- User login success rate > 99%
