## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.1 established the foundational infrastructure including:
- Monorepo setup with Turborepo and proper TypeScript configuration
- Supabase database with initial users table schema and enterprise security settings
- Fastify backend with authMiddleware foundation and JWT token handling patterns
- Basic health check endpoints with performance monitoring for enterprise compliance
- CI/CD pipeline with automated testing and deployment to staging/production environments

### Data Models
**User Table Schema (Already Established):**
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    organization VARCHAR(255),
    role VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL CHECK (role IN ('designer', 'manager', 'admin')),
    preferences JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    last_login_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md]

**User TypeScript Interface:**
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  name: string;
  organization?: string;
  role: 'designer' | 'manager' | 'admin';
  preferences: UserPreferences;
  createdAt: Date;
  lastLoginAt: Date;
}

interface UserPreferences {
  defaultAudience: string;
  preferredComplexity: 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced';
  accessibilityStrictness: 'standard' | 'strict';
  aiGenerationStyle: 'concise' | 'detailed' | 'comprehensive';
}
```

### API Specifications
**tRPC Auth Router (Required Implementation):**
```typescript
auth: router({
  login: publicProcedure
    .input(z.object({
      email: z.string().email(),
      password: z.string().min(8)
    }))
    .mutation(async ({ input, ctx }) => {
      return await ctx.auth.signIn(input);
    }),

  me: protectedProcedure
    .query(async ({ ctx }) => {
      return await ctx.db.user.findUnique({
        where: { id: ctx.user.id }
      });
    })
})
```
[Source: architecture/api-specification.md#trpc-router-definitions]

**Authentication Middleware Pattern:**
```typescript
export async function authMiddleware(req: NextRequest) {
  const supabase = createMiddlewareClient({ req, res });
  const { data: { session }, error } = await supabase.auth.getSession();
  
  if (error || !session) {
    return { success: false, error: 'Authentication required' };
  }
  
  return { success: true, user, session };
}
```
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#middlewareguards]

### Component Specifications
**Authentication State Management (Zustand):**
```typescript
interface AppState {
  user: User | null;
  isAuthenticated: boolean;
  // ... other state
}
```
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-structure]

**Frontend Component Organization:**
- Authentication pages: `apps/web/src/pages/auth/` (login, register, reset-password)
- Auth components: `apps/web/src/components/auth/` for reusable auth UI elements
- State management: `apps/web/src/stores/auth.ts` for Zustand auth store
- Services: `apps/web/src/services/auth.ts` for tRPC auth client integration

### Technical Constraints
**Critical Authentication Rules:**
- **Always use authMiddleware:** Never implement custom auth logic, use the established authMiddleware pattern for protected routes
- **Supabase Auth Integration:** All authentication must go through Supabase Auth service, never implement custom JWT handling
- **Type Safety:** Use tRPC auth router for type-safe authentication API calls, never direct HTTP requests
- **Environment Variables:** Access auth config through packages/shared config objects, never process.env directly
- **Security Headers:** Always use enterprise security headers and CORS policies from Story 1.1 foundation
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]

**Technology Versions (From Story 1.1):**
- Supabase Auth with enterprise SSO support and GDPR compliance
- TypeScript 5.3+ for frontend and backend type safety
- Next.js 14.0+ with App Router for authentication pages
- Zustand 4.4+ for lightweight authentication state management
- Tailwind CSS 3.3+ with Headless UI 1.7+ for WCAG AA compliant auth forms
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

### Testing Requirements
**Authentication Testing Strategy:**
- **Frontend Tests:** `apps/web/tests/auth/` - Component tests for auth forms using Testing Library with accessibility validation
- **Backend Tests:** `apps/api/tests/auth/` - API endpoint tests using Vitest and Supertest for auth functions
- **Integration Tests:** Cross-component auth flow testing with tRPC client integration
- **E2E Tests:** `tests/e2e/auth.spec.ts` - Complete authentication workflows using Playwright
- **Security Tests:** Authentication bypass attempts, session management, and brute force protection validation
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Specific Test Requirements:**
- Verify JWT token validation and expiration handling
- Test password strength requirements and validation
- Validate email verification flow and error states
- Test role-based authorization for different user types
- Verify GDPR compliance features (data export, deletion)
- Test session management and automatic logout functionality

### Security Considerations
**Enterprise Security Foundation (From Story 1.1):**
- JWT token handling with proper expiration and refresh patterns
- Security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options) already configured
- Rate limiting infrastructure for DoS protection
- CORS policies for staging and production environments
[Source: Story 1.1 completion notes]

**Authentication-Specific Security:**
- Password complexity requirements and breach detection
- Email verification to prevent unauthorized account creation
- Session management with concurrent session limits
- Audit trail for authentication events and user data changes
- GDPR-compliant data handling with export and deletion capabilities

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2024-08-17

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment: ❌ REQUIRES MAJOR REFACTORING**

The implementation demonstrates solid technical execution in backend services, authentication middleware, and UI components. However, it contains **critical architectural violations** that fundamentally contradict the project's coding standards and must be addressed before approval.

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive Supabase Auth service with enterprise security features
- Well-designed authentication middleware with role-based authorization
- Accessible frontend components following WCAG AA guidelines
- Comprehensive unit tests with proper mocking strategies
- Strong TypeScript type safety across shared packages

**Critical Issues:**
- **BLOCKING**: Frontend auth store violates Critical Fullstack Rule by making direct HTTP calls instead of using tRPC client
- **BLOCKING**: Missing actual tRPC auth router implementation despite claims of completion
- **BLOCKING**: Task completion inconsistency - many tasks marked complete in notes but incomplete in task list

### Refactoring Performed

**None - Blocking issues require developer intervention before refactoring can proceed**

The architectural violations are too fundamental to fix with minor refactoring. The entire frontend API integration approach needs to be redesigned to comply with the tRPC architecture requirement.

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ❌ **CRITICAL VIOLATION** - Direct HTTP calls prohibited (see Critical Fullstack Rules)
- **Project Structure**: ✅ File organization follows unified project structure correctly
- **Testing Strategy**: ✅ Comprehensive unit tests implemented with proper coverage
- **All ACs Met**: ❌ **PARTIAL** - Core functionality implemented but architecture non-compliant
