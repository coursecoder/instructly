**Primary Goal:** Transform instructional design from craft-based to evidence-based profession using Clark & Mayer framework
- Platform must support AI-powered content classification and generation
- Infrastructure must handle sophisticated AI processing workflows
- Foundation must support professional credibility through automated documentation
[Source: prd/goals-and-background-context.md]

**Critical Performance Requirements:**
- NFR1: Generate lesson plans in under 3 seconds, accessibility checking in under 1 second
- NFR2: Support 1000+ concurrent users without performance degradation  
- NFR5: AI token costs must remain below 30% of revenue for sustainable unit economics
- Infrastructure must include performance monitoring and AI cost tracking from day one
[Source: prd/requirements.md]

**Enterprise Compliance Foundation:**
- SOC 2 standards compliance for enterprise customers
- GDPR compliance for EU users with proper data handling
- Role-based access controls and audit trail capabilities
- Encryption at rest and in transit requirements
[Source: prd/requirements.md]

### Data Models
**Database Schema Implementation:**
- Users table with UUID primary keys, JSONB preferences, and role-based access (designer/manager/admin)
- Projects table with collaborative features, status tracking, and owner/collaborator relationships
- Proper indexes for performance on owner_id, status, and full-text search capabilities
- All tables use timestamptz for created_at/updated_at tracking
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md]

**TypeScript Type Definitions:**
- User interface with organization, role, and preferences structure
- Project interface with settings, collaborators, and branding options
- Shared types must be defined in packages/shared and imported across frontend/backend
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]

### API Specifications
**Health Check and Performance Monitoring Endpoints Required:**
- `/api/health` - System status endpoint with performance metrics
- `/api/metrics` - AI cost tracking and performance monitoring endpoint
- Must return JSON with status, uptime, database connectivity, response times
- Include concurrent user tracking and memory/CPU metrics for scalability monitoring
- Must integrate with Fastify framework and follow error handling patterns
[Source: architecture/api-specification.md + PRD performance requirements]

**tRPC Router Foundation:**
- Set up AppRouter type export for end-to-end type safety
- Configure protected/public procedure patterns
- Implement auth middleware integration for future authentication endpoints
[Source: architecture/api-specification.md]

### Component Specifications
**Accessibility-First Architecture:**
- Use Tailwind CSS 3.3+ with Headless UI 1.7+ for WCAG AA compliance built-in
- Follow component template from frontend architecture with proper TypeScript interfaces
- Implement proper ARIA attributes and semantic HTML structure
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

**State Management Pattern:**
- Use Zustand 4.4+ for lightweight global state management
- Essential for future AI response caching and user preferences

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md + PRD requirements]

### Technical Constraints
**Critical Fullstack Rules:**
- Type sharing: Always define types in packages/shared, never direct imports
- API calls: Never direct HTTP calls, use tRPC client for type safety
- Environment variables: Access only through config objects, never process.env directly
- Authentication: Always use authMiddleware, never custom auth logic
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Deployment Requirements:**
- Vercel platform for frontend and serverless functions
- Build commands: `npm run build:web` and `npm run build:api`
- GitHub Actions with staging/production environment separation
[Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md]

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Strategy Implementation:**
- Vitest + Testing Library for frontend unit/integration tests
- Vitest + Supertest for backend API endpoint testing
- Playwright for E2E testing foundation
- Test organization: apps/web/tests/ and apps/api/tests/ with proper categorization
- Coverage reporting and fast execution for developer feedback loops
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Test File Organization:**
```
apps/web/tests/components/     # Component unit tests
apps/web/tests/integration/    # Frontend integration tests
apps/api/tests/functions/      # Function unit tests

## Testing

### Testing Standards
**Test File Locations:**
- Frontend tests: `apps/web/tests/` with subdirectories for components, hooks, services, integration, e2e
- Backend tests: `apps/api/tests/` with subdirectories for functions, services, middleware, integration
- E2E tests: `tests/e2e/` in project root

**Testing Frameworks:**
- Vitest 1.0+ for fast unit and integration testing (frontend and backend)
- Testing Library 14.0+ for React component testing with accessibility testing
- Playwright 1.40+ for end-to-end user workflow testing
- Supertest 6.3+ for API endpoint testing

**Testing Patterns:**
- Follow testing pyramid: more unit tests, fewer integration tests, minimal E2E tests
- Test organization by domain areas (ai/, accessibility/, lesson/, etc.)
- Component tests must verify accessibility compliance and proper TypeScript interfaces
- API tests must validate error handling, authentication, and response formats

**Specific Testing Requirements for This Story:**
- Health check endpoint tests verifying proper JSON response format and performance metrics
- Performance testing for NFR1 compliance (3-second generation, 1-second accessibility checking)
- Scalability testing foundation for NFR2 (1000+ concurrent users)
- AI cost tracking endpoint validation for NFR5 monitoring
- Basic frontend component rendering tests with accessibility compliance verification
- Database connectivity and schema validation tests including encryption verification
- Enterprise security testing (authentication, authorization, GDPR compliance)
- CI/CD pipeline validation with automated test execution and performance benchmarking
- Docker container functionality verification with enterprise security configurations
