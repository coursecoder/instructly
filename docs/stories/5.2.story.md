# Story 5.2: API Structure Consolidation & Health Endpoint Cleanup

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** platform maintainer,
**I want** consistent API structure without duplicate endpoints,
**so that** deployment and routing work reliably without conflicts.

## Context & Problem Statement
**Current Critical Issues (from Code Review):**
- **DEPLOYMENT BLOCKER**: Duplicate health endpoints causing routing conflicts
- **INCONSISTENT STRUCTURE**: Files in wrong locations creating deployment confusion
- **ROUTING CONFLICTS**: Mixed API endpoint patterns (`/trpc` vs `/api/trpc`) causing 404 errors
- **DEAD CODE**: Orphaned files and unused API endpoints cluttering deployment

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Consolidate Health Endpoints**: Remove duplicate health.ts files and create single authoritative health check
2. **Standardize API Routing**: Ensure all API endpoints follow consistent tRPC pattern with clear routing structure
3. **Clean File Structure**: Remove orphaned files and organize API structure according to project conventions
4. **Update Deployment Configuration**: Ensure Vercel configuration matches consolidated API structure
5. **Comprehensive Health Checks**: Implement health endpoint that validates database, AI services, and all dependencies
6. **Remove Dead Code**: Eliminate unused API files and outdated endpoint implementations
7. **Update Frontend Integration**: Ensure frontend API client uses standardized endpoints consistently
8. **Add Integration Testing**: Test all consolidated endpoints to prevent routing regressions
9. **Document API Structure**: Update deployment and API documentation with final structure
10. **Validate Deployment**: Ensure clean deployment without routing conflicts or 404 errors

## Dev Notes

### Current File Structure Issues
**Duplicate Files Identified (from git status):**
```
❌ apps/api/api/health.ts         (DELETE - wrong location)
❌ apps/api/api/trpc/[trpc].ts    (DELETE - wrong location)  
❌ apps/api/health.ts             (DELETE - orphaned)
❌ apps/api/trpc/                 (DELETE - duplicate directory)
✅ apps/api/src/functions/health.ts (KEEP - correct location)
✅ apps/api/src/trpc/             (KEEP - correct structure)
```

**Target API Structure:**
```
apps/api/src/
├── functions/
│   ├── health.ts              # Single health endpoint
│   └── trpc/
│       └── [trpc].ts          # Main tRPC handler
├── trpc/
│   ├── index.ts               # tRPC configuration
│   └── routers/
│       ├── index.ts           # App router
│       ├── auth.ts            # Auth procedures
│       ├── ai.ts              # AI procedures
│       ├── projects.ts        # Project procedures
│       └── lessons.ts         # Lesson procedures
└── services/                  # Business logic services
```

### Routing Standards
**Standardized Endpoint Patterns:**
- **Health Check**: `GET /api/health` → `apps/api/src/functions/health.ts`
- **tRPC API**: `POST /api/trpc/{procedure}` → `apps/api/src/functions/trpc/[trpc].ts`
- **Static Assets**: Follow Next.js public/ directory conventions

**Vercel Configuration Requirements:**
```json
{
  "functions": {
    "apps/api/src/functions/health.ts": {
      "maxDuration": 10
    },
    "apps/api/src/functions/trpc/[trpc].ts": {
      "maxDuration": 30
    }
  },
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/api/health",
      "destination": "/api/health"
    },
    {
      "source": "/api/trpc/:path*",
      "destination": "/api/trpc/:path*"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Health Check Implementation
**Comprehensive Health Endpoint Requirements:**
```typescript
interface HealthCheckResponse {
  status: 'healthy' | 'degraded' | 'unhealthy';
  timestamp: string;
  version: string;
  services: {
    database: {
      status: 'healthy' | 'unhealthy';
      responseTime: number;
      connection: boolean;
    };
    openai: {
      status: 'healthy' | 'unhealthy';
      responseTime: number;
      apiKey: boolean;
    };
    supabase: {
      status: 'healthy' | 'unhealthy';
      responseTime: number;
      auth: boolean;
    };
  };
  environment: 'development' | 'staging' | 'production';
}
```

### Frontend Integration Updates
**tRPC Client Configuration:**
```typescript
// Update frontend tRPC client to use standardized endpoints
const trpc = createTRPCNext<AppRouter>({
  config() {
    return {
      links: [
        httpBatchLink({
          url: `${getBaseUrl()}/api/trpc`, // Standardized endpoint
        }),
      ],
    };
  },
});
```

### Deployment Validation Checklist
**Pre-Deployment Testing:**
- [ ] Health endpoint responds correctly: `GET /api/health`
- [ ] tRPC procedures work: `POST /api/trpc/auth.me`
- [ ] No 404 errors on any API endpoints
- [ ] Vercel function deployment succeeds without conflicts
- [ ] Frontend can successfully call all API endpoints
- [ ] No broken imports or missing file references

### Risk Assessment
**High Risk Areas:**
- **Import Path Changes**: File moves may break existing imports
- **Deployment Configuration**: Vercel config changes could cause deployment failures
- **Frontend Integration**: API client configuration changes could break frontend
- **Database Connections**: Health check implementation could expose connection issues

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Incremental Changes**: Update one endpoint at a time with testing
- **Backup Configuration**: Keep backup of working Vercel configuration
- **Staging Deployment**: Test all changes in staging before production
- **Rollback Plan**: Document rollback procedures for each consolidation step

### Success Metrics
**Technical Metrics:**
- Zero 404 errors on API endpoints after consolidation
- Health endpoint response time < 500ms
- Single source of truth for each API endpoint
- Clean git status with no duplicate files

**Deployment Metrics:**
- Zero deployment failures related to API structure
- Build time improvement from removing dead code
- Reduced function count in Vercel deployment
- Clear API documentation with 100% endpoint coverage

### Testing Strategy
**Integration Test Categories:**
- **Health Endpoint**: Comprehensive service dependency validation
- **tRPC Endpoints**: All procedures accessible via standardized routing
- **Deployment**: Vercel function deployment and routing
- **Frontend**: Client-side API integration after changes
