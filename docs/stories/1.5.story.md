# Story 1.5: Bulk Lesson Reordering - Brownfield Addition

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As an** instructional designer,

4. Existing single lesson reordering continues to work unchanged
5. New functionality follows existing drag-and-drop pattern from Story 1.4
6. Integration with project dashboard maintains current lesson count and status display behavior
7. Change is covered by unit tests for API endpoints and integration tests for UI components
8. Documentation is updated in user guide for bulk operations section
9. No regression in existing single lesson reordering functionality verified

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.4 completion:
- **Drag-and-Drop Foundation**: @dnd-kit packages already installed and configured with sortable list components
- **LessonManager Component**: Existing drag-and-drop infrastructure ready for extension with multi-select capability
- **Database Architecture**: Lesson sequence management patterns established with transaction handling
- **State Management**: Zustand lessonStore provides foundation for bulk operation state management
- **Testing Patterns**: Component and store testing frameworks established for drag-and-drop functionality

### Data Models
**Lesson Sequence Management:** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#lesson]
```typescript
interface Lesson {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  projectId: string;
  sequenceOrder?: number; // For bulk reordering operations
  // ... existing fields
}

interface BulkReorderRequest {
  projectId: string;
  lessonSequence: string[];
  selectedLessons: string[];
}
```

### API Specifications
**tRPC Lessons Router Extension:** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#service-architecture]
```typescript
lessons: router({
  // ... existing procedures
  bulkUpdateSequence: protectedProcedure
    .input(z.object({
      projectId: z.string().uuid(),
      lessonSequence: z.array(z.string().uuid()),
      selectedLessons: z.array(z.string().uuid())
    }))
    .mutation(async ({ input, ctx }) => {
      return await ctx.repositories.lessons.updateBulkSequence(input);
    })
})
```

### Component Specifications
**LessonManager Enhancement:** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-template]

- Add multi-select state using React useState with selection tracking
- Implement accessible multi-select patterns with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- Follow existing Tailwind CSS styling patterns for consistency
- Include loading states and error boundaries for bulk operations

**Multi-Select Implementation Pattern:** [Source: architecture/components.md#user-interface-components]
```typescript
interface LessonManagerProps {
  lessons: Lesson[];
  onReorder: (lessonIds: string[]) => void;
  onBulkReorder: (selectedLessons: string[], newSequence: string[]) => void;
  multiSelectEnabled?: boolean;
}

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-20

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

The bulk lesson reordering implementation demonstrates strong senior-level architectural patterns with comprehensive multi-select functionality, intelligent drag-and-drop handling, and robust state management. The code follows React best practices with proper TypeScript integration and maintains backward compatibility. However, several critical test issues and edge case handling problems were identified that require developer attention.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: apps/api/tests/functions/lessons-bulk-reorder.test.ts
  - **Change**: Fixed authentication mock context by adding missing session object
  - **Why**: Tests were failing because protectedProcedure middleware requires both user and session
  - **How**: Added session: { access_token: 'mock-token' } to mockContext

- **File**: apps/web/tests/components/LessonManager.test.tsx  
  - **Change**: Enhanced test with proper form field clearing and BulkOperations mock
  - **Why**: Duration field test was failing due to value concatenation instead of replacement
  - **How**: Added user.clear() before typing and proper BulkOperations component mock

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Follows type sharing patterns, tRPC usage, and Zustand state management correctly
- Project Structure: ✓ Files located correctly per unified project structure (components/lesson/, stores/, trpc/routers/)
- Testing Strategy: ✗ Test failures prevent full validation of testing compliance
- All ACs Met: ✗ Test failures indicate potential gaps in AC validation

### Improvements Checklist

[x] Fixed authentication context in API tests (apps/api/tests/functions/lessons-bulk-reorder.test.ts)
[x] Fixed form field clearing in frontend tests (apps/web/tests/components/LessonManager.test.tsx)
[x] Added BulkOperations component mock for proper test rendering
[ ] Fix UUID validation in bulk reordering tests - all test inputs need proper UUID format
[ ] Complete resolution of remaining 8 API test failures related to UUID validation
[ ] Address frontend test issue with duration field value concatenation (60180 instead of 180)
[ ] Verify drag-and-drop functionality with proper @dnd-kit testing utilities
[ ] Add performance testing for 50+ lesson bulk operations as specified in requirements
[ ] Implement missing bulk operations (duplicate, move, archive, delete) that currently throw "not yet implemented" errors

### Security Review

✓ Authentication and authorization properly implemented in API endpoints with user access validation
✓ Input validation using Zod schemas prevents malicious data injection
✓ No hardcoded secrets or sensitive data exposed in implementation
✓ Proper error handling prevents information leakage

### Performance Considerations

✓ Optimistic updates implemented for better UX during bulk operations  
✓ Progress tracking and loading states provide user feedback
⚠ Database transaction handling implemented but not performance tested with large datasets
⚠ Bulk operations may need additional optimization for 50+ lesson requirement

### Final Status

✗ Changes Required - See unchecked items above

**Critical Issues Requiring Developer Attention:**
1. **Test Suite Failures**: 8 API tests failing due to UUID format validation - all test data needs proper UUID format
2. **Incomplete Bulk Operations**: Store methods for duplicate/move/archive/delete throw "not implemented" errors
3. **Form Input Bug**: Duration concatenation issue in tests indicates potential UX problem
4. **Performance Validation**: Large dataset testing (50+ lessons) not yet implemented as required by AC

**Recommendation**: Address test failures and implement missing bulk operations before marking story as Done. The core drag-and-drop functionality is well-architected but needs complete test validation.
