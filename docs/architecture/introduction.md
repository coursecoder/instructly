# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for **Instructly**, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

Based on the PRD analysis, this appears to be a **greenfield project** with specific technology preferences outlined:

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript for accessibility support (WCAG AA compliance)
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express/Fastify for AI integration
- **Platform**: AWS preferred for enterprise SOC 2 compliance
- **Repository**: Monorepo approach specified for shared code and unified testing

**Decision**: N/A - Greenfield project with clear technical preferences from PRD
