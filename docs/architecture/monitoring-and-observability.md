# Monitoring and Observability

## Monitoring Stack
- **Frontend Monitoring:** Vercel Analytics + Real User Monitoring (RUM)
- **Backend Monitoring:** Vercel Functions Analytics + custom metrics
- **Error Tracking:** Sentry for both frontend and backend errors
- **Performance Monitoring:** Web Vitals tracking, API response time monitoring

## Key Metrics

**Frontend Metrics:**
- Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)
- JavaScript errors and stack traces
- API response times from client perspective
- User interactions and conversion funnels

**Backend Metrics:**
- Request rate and response times per endpoint
- Error rate by function and error type
- Database query performance and slow queries
- AI API usage, costs, and response times
- Authentication success/failure rates

This architecture provides a comprehensive foundation for the Instructly platform, balancing enterprise requirements with development velocity while optimizing for AI cost control and accessibility compliance.
