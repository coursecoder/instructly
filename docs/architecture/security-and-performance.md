# Security and Performance

## Security Requirements

**Frontend Security:**
- CSP Headers: `default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval'; connect-src 'self' *.supabase.co *.openai.com`
- XSS Prevention: Content sanitization, React's built-in XSS protection, strict CSP
- Secure Storage: HTTPOnly cookies for auth tokens, no sensitive data in localStorage

**Backend Security:**
- Input Validation: Zod schemas for all API endpoints, SQL injection prevention via Supabase
- Rate Limiting: 100 requests/minute per user, 1000 requests/hour per IP
- CORS Policy: Restricted to known frontends and partner domains

**Authentication Security:**
- Token Storage: HTTPOnly, Secure, SameSite cookies
- Session Management: JWT with 24-hour expiry, refresh token rotation
- Password Policy: Minimum 12 characters, complexity requirements

## Performance Optimization

**Frontend Performance:**
- Bundle Size Target: <250KB initial bundle, <50KB per route
- Loading Strategy: Progressive loading with Suspense, lazy loading for non-critical routes
- Caching Strategy: SWR for API calls, browser caching for static assets

**Backend Performance:**
- Response Time Target: <3 seconds for AI generation, <500ms for data queries
- Database Optimization: Indexed queries, connection pooling, read replicas for analytics
- Caching Strategy: Redis for AI responses (24hr TTL), CDN for static content
