# Epic 5: Technical Debt Resolution & Production Readiness

Resolve critical technical debt and production blockers identified through comprehensive code review to ensure system reliability, security, and maintainability. This epic addresses authentication gaps, API inconsistencies, test suite failures, and environment security issues that prevent production deployment while establishing robust operational foundations.

## Story 5.1: Authentication System Enablement & Security Hardening

As a platform administrator,
I want proper JWT authentication and security controls enabled,
so that user access is secure and the platform is production-ready with proper authorization.

**Current State Issues:**
- Auth router disabled in production (`apps/api/src/trpc/routers/index.ts:3`)
- Placeholder JWT validation with hardcoded demo users
- Missing proper session management and security middleware

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Enable auth router in main tRPC router configuration
2. Implement proper JWT token validation with signature verification
3. Replace placeholder auth service with full Supabase Auth integration
4. Add comprehensive session management with refresh token handling
5. Implement rate limiting for authentication endpoints
6. Add audit logging for all authentication events
7. Remove hardcoded demo user IDs and implement proper user context
8. Add comprehensive authentication middleware tests
9. Validate all protected endpoints require proper authentication
10. Update environment variables for production auth configuration

**Technical Context:**
- **Files to Modify:** `apps/api/src/trpc/routers/index.ts`, `apps/api/src/services/auth.ts`, `apps/api/src/trpc/index.ts`
- **Security Requirements:** JWT signature validation, session timeout, audit trail
- **Integration Points:** Supabase Auth, tRPC middleware, frontend auth store

## Story 5.2: API Structure Consolidation & Health Endpoint Cleanup

As a platform maintainer,
I want consistent API structure without duplicate endpoints,
so that deployment and routing work reliably without conflicts.

**Current State Issues:**
- Duplicate health endpoints causing routing conflicts
- Inconsistent file structure with files in wrong locations
- Mixed API endpoint patterns (`/trpc` vs `/api/trpc`)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Consolidate duplicate health endpoints into single authoritative version
2. Remove orphaned health.ts files from incorrect locations
3. Standardize API routing structure with clear endpoint patterns
4. Update Vercel configuration to match consolidated structure
5. Ensure all API endpoints follow consistent tRPC pattern
6. Add comprehensive health check covering database, AI services, and dependencies
7. Update frontend API client to use standardized endpoints
8. Remove dead code and unused API files
9. Add integration tests for all consolidated endpoints
10. Update deployment documentation with final API structure

**Technical Context:**
- **Files to Clean:** `apps/api/health.ts`, `apps/api/api/health.ts`, duplicate tRPC endpoints
- **Routing Standards:** Consistent `/trpc` pattern, proper Vercel function mapping
- **Health Checks:** Database connectivity, OpenAI API, Supabase status

## Story 5.3: Test Suite Resolution & Quality Assurance

As a development team member,
I want all tests passing with comprehensive coverage,
so that code quality is assured and regressions are prevented.

**Current State Issues:**
- 6 failing API tests in authentication and AI workflow modules
- 5 failing frontend tests in ClassificationPanel and ProjectStore components
- Missing UUID format validation in bulk reordering tests
- Test infrastructure gaps and mock setup issues

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Fix all 6 failing API tests in authentication service
2. Resolve 5 failing frontend component tests
3. Implement proper UUID format validation in all test data
4. Fix test mock setup and hoisting issues
5. Add comprehensive test coverage for authentication flows
6. Resolve ClassificationPanel confidence indicator styling tests
7. Fix ProjectStore optimistic update rollback tests
8. Add performance tests for bulk operations (50+ lessons)
9. Implement proper drag-and-drop testing utilities
10. Achieve 95%+ test coverage across all critical paths

**Technical Context:**
- **Test Files:** `apps/api/tests/auth/*`, `apps/web/tests/components/*`, `apps/api/tests/functions/*`
- **Testing Framework:** Vitest, Testing Library, Mock Service Worker
- **Coverage Areas:** Authentication, AI services, drag-and-drop, state management

## Story 5.4: Environment Configuration Security & Management

As a platform administrator,
I want secure environment variable management and proper configuration,
so that API keys are protected and environment-specific settings are properly managed.

**Current State Issues:**
- API keys potentially exposed in client-side code
- Inconsistent environment variable management across services
- Missing production environment validation
- Supabase environment variables not properly secured

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Audit all environment variables for proper server-side only usage
2. Implement environment variable validation schema with required/optional checks
3. Secure all API keys (OpenAI, Supabase) to server-side only
4. Add environment-specific configuration files with proper inheritance
5. Implement runtime environment validation with startup checks
6. Add comprehensive logging for environment configuration issues
7. Create environment setup documentation for deployment
8. Implement proper secrets management for production deployment
9. Add environment health checks to startup sequence
10. Update CI/CD pipeline with proper environment variable handling

**Technical Context:**
- **Environment Files:** `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.production`
- **Security Focus:** API key protection, server-side validation, secrets management
- **Validation Schema:** Runtime checks, startup validation, error reporting

## Story 5.5: Production Monitoring & Operational Excellence

As a platform administrator,
I want comprehensive monitoring and operational tooling,
so that the platform is observable and maintainable in production.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Implement comprehensive application logging with structured format
2. Add performance monitoring for API endpoints and database queries
3. Create operational dashboards for system health and metrics
4. Implement error tracking and alerting for critical failures
5. Add database connection pooling and monitoring
6. Implement distributed caching with Redis for performance
7. Add comprehensive backup and recovery procedures
8. Create runbook documentation for common operational tasks
9. Implement automated health checks and monitoring alerts
10. Add capacity planning metrics and scaling guidelines

**Technical Context:**
- **Monitoring Stack:** Application logs, performance metrics, error tracking
- **Infrastructure:** Redis caching, connection pooling, health checks
- **Operational Tools:** Dashboards, alerts, runbooks, backup procedures

## Technical Dependencies & Sequencing

**Story Execution Order:**
1. **Story 5.1** (Authentication) - **CRITICAL** - Blocks all other production concerns
2. **Story 5.2** (API Cleanup) - Enables reliable deployment
3. **Story 5.3** (Test Resolution) - Ensures quality and prevents regressions
4. **Story 5.4** (Environment Security) - Production security requirements
5. **Story 5.5** (Monitoring) - Operational excellence and observability

**Cross-Story Dependencies:**
- Authentication system (5.1) must be completed before environment security (5.4)
- API cleanup (5.2) enables proper test resolution (5.3)
- All stories contribute to monitoring and observability (5.5)

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Each story includes rollback procedures for safe deployment
- Comprehensive testing prevents regression during fixes
