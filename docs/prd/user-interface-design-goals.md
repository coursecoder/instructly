# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

Professional, enterprise-grade interface that positions instructional designers as credible experts rather than creative hobbyists. The platform should feel like sophisticated business intelligence software (think Tableau or Salesforce) rather than consumer design tools, emphasizing data-driven decision making and evidence-based methodology. Clean, accessible design that works seamlessly for both quick lesson planning sessions and detailed stakeholder presentations.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Guided Workflow Approach:** Step-by-step wizard-style interface for lesson creation that demonstrates professional methodology while reducing cognitive load
- **Dashboard-Centric Design:** Central hub showing project status, compliance scores, and professional metrics that can be shared with stakeholders
- **Evidence-Based Transparency:** Every AI recommendation includes visible rationale and Clark & Mayer framework justification to build user confidence and stakeholder credibility

## Core Screens and Views

- Project Dashboard (overview of all lesson plans, compliance status, recent activity)
- Topic Analysis Input & Results (Clark & Mayer classification with detailed explanations)
- Lesson Plan Builder (structured creation interface with real-time accessibility checking)
- Professional Documentation Viewer (generated ID Chart with methodology explanations)
- Stakeholder Sharing Interface (clean, presentation-ready views of completed work)
- Compliance Audit Reports (detailed accessibility documentation for enterprise requirements)

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

Enterprise accessibility compliance is a core business requirement, not just a nice-to-have. The platform itself must demonstrate the accessibility standards it helps users achieve.

## Branding

Professional, credible, evidence-based aesthetic that elevates instructional design as a legitimate business discipline. The Instructly brand combines the authority of "instruct" with modern SaaS positioning through the "-ly" suffix, creating a name that works in enterprise boardrooms while maintaining tech-forward appeal. Visual design should emphasize data visualization elements, clean typography, and subtle use of Clark & Mayer framework colors to reinforce pedagogical credibility.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Primary focus on desktop/laptop for detailed lesson planning work, with tablet support for stakeholder presentations and reviews. Mobile support secondary priority as this is professional workflow software.
