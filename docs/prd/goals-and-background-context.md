# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Transform instructional design from craft-based practice to evidence-based profession with AI-powered Clark & Mayer framework classification
- Eliminate "blank page syndrome" by providing research-backed starting points that reduce lesson planning time from 40-60% research to <20%
- Establish professional credibility for instructional designers through AI-generated diagrams, activities, and automated documentation systems
- Ensure enterprise accessibility compliance (Section 508/WCAG 2.1) with 90%+ automated accuracy, eliminating legal risk and manual remediation
- Achieve market validation with 100 paying customers and $500K ARR within 12 months, targeting sales enablement teams as premium entry segment
- Create industry-standard platform recognized by professional organizations (ATD, ISPI) for evidence-based instructional design practices

## Background Context

Corporate instructional designers face a triple challenge that undermines professional effectiveness: rapid topic mastery pressure (2-3 week deadlines for complex technical content), blank page syndrome requiring extensive manual research, and a professional credibility gap with stakeholders who possess superior subject matter expertise. This results in 40-60% of project time being wasted on basic research rather than applying instructional design expertise, leading to superficial content that fails technical audiences and positioning IDs as "PowerPoint creators" rather than learning experience architects.

The convergence of AI adoption acceleration (100M+ ChatGPT users), mandatory accessibility compliance pressure, and a 15+ year professional recognition crisis creates urgent market opportunity. Existing solutions fall short: generic AI tools lack pedagogical frameworks, traditional ID tools provide no research foundation, and manual processes cannot scale with enterprise demands. The proposed AI-powered platform addresses this by combining intelligent topic analysis using Clark & Mayer's framework, professional credibility generation through sophisticated outputs, and built-in compliance automationâ€”transforming instructional design into a legitimate, evidence-based profession similar to how standardized tools legitimized accounting.
