# Epic 2: AI-Powered Lesson Generation Engine

Build comprehensive lesson plan generation with Clark & Mayer framework integration, creating complete instructor-led and self-paced outputs with professional documentation. This epic delivers the core value proposition by transforming AI topic analysis into complete, professional lesson plans that eliminate "blank page syndrome."

## Story 2.1: Comprehensive Lesson Plan Generation

As an instructional designer,
I want to generate complete lesson plans from topic analysis,
so that I can quickly create professional, evidence-based learning experiences.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Generate lesson plans from existing topic classifications within lessons
2. Create separate outputs for instructor-led and self-paced eLearning formats
3. Include learning objectives aligned with Clark & Mayer content type
4. Generate appropriate assessment strategies based on content classification
5. Provide estimated timing and pacing recommendations for each lesson component
6. Include materials list and preparation requirements
7. Auto-save lesson plans with version history tracking
8. Export functionality for common formats (PDF, Word, PowerPoint outline)

## Story 2.2: Interactive Activity Generator

As an instructional designer,
I want AI-generated activities specific to technical content types,
so that I can provide engaging, hands-on learning experiences for complex topics.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Generate activities based on content type classification (facts=recall exercises, concepts=categorization, processes=step-by-step practice, procedures=guided practice, principles=scenario application)
2. Create progressive learning sequences building from simple to complex
3. Include step-by-step visual exercise descriptions
4. Provide alternative activity options for different learning preferences
5. Generate discussion questions and reflection prompts
6. Include group activity options for instructor-led formats
7. Provide activity timing estimates and difficulty levels
8. Integration with lesson plan structure and learning objectives

## Story 2.3: Learning Objectives & Assessment Alignment

As an instructional designer,
I want automatically generated learning objectives and aligned assessments,
so that I can ensure pedagogically sound lesson structure and measurable outcomes.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Generate SMART learning objectives based on Clark & Mayer content type
2. Align objectives with appropriate Bloom's taxonomy levels for content type
3. Create formative assessment options throughout lesson progression
4. Generate summative assessment suggestions with multiple formats (quiz, practical application, project-based)
5. Provide rubrics and evaluation criteria for complex assessments
6. Include accessibility considerations for all assessment formats
7. Map assessments back to specific learning objectives for validation
8. Generate assessment timing and scoring guidelines

## Story 2.4: Multi-Format Output Generation

As an instructional designer,
I want lesson plans optimized for different delivery formats,
so that I can efficiently create materials for various training scenarios.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Generate instructor-led format with facilitator notes, timing, and interaction cues
2. Create self-paced eLearning format with self-check points and progress markers
3. Provide virtual classroom adaptation with engagement strategies
4. Include hybrid format recommendations combining synchronous and asynchronous elements
5. Generate participant handouts and reference materials
6. Create facilitator preparation checklists and setup requirements
7. Provide adaptation notes for different audience sizes and technical levels
8. Include troubleshooting guides for common delivery challenges
