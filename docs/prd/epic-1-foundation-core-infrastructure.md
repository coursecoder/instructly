# Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure

Establish foundational project infrastructure with user authentication and basic project management while delivering immediate value through AI-powered topic analysis using Clark & Mayer framework. This epic provides the technical foundation for all subsequent features while giving users their first experience with the platform's core AI capabilities.

## Story 1.1: Project Setup & Health Monitoring

As a platform administrator,
I want basic application infrastructure with health monitoring,
so that the platform is deployable and maintainable from day one.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. React frontend with TypeScript setup and accessibility-first component architecture
2. Node.js backend API with Express/Fastify and TypeScript configuration
3. PostgreSQL database with initial user and project schemas
4. Basic health check endpoints responding with system status
5. Docker containerization for consistent deployment environments
6. Basic CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment

## Story 1.2: User Authentication & Registration

As an instructional designer,
I want to create an account and securely log into the platform,
so that I can access personalized lesson planning tools.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. User registration with email validation and secure password requirements
2. Login/logout functionality with JWT token management
3. Password reset capability via email
4. Basic user profile management (name, organization, role)
5. Session management with automatic logout after inactivity
6. GDPR-compliant data handling and privacy controls

## Story 1.3: AI Topic Analysis Engine (MVP)

As an instructional designer,
I want to input a topic and receive Clark & Mayer framework classification,
so that I have evidence-based starting points for lesson planning.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Text input interface for topic submission
2. Integration with OpenAI GPT-4 API for content analysis
3. Clark & Mayer classification output (facts, concepts, processes, procedures, principles)
4. Detailed rationale explaining classification decision and methodology
5. Recommended instructional methods based on content type
6. Response caching to optimize costs and performance
7. Error handling for API failures with graceful degradation

## Story 1.4: Project & Lesson Management Structure

As an instructional designer,
I want to create projects containing multiple lessons with flexible organization,
so that I can structure complex training programs and manage lessons of varying lengths and complexity.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Create new project with title, description, target audience, and estimated duration
2. Within projects, create multiple lessons with individual titles and descriptions
3. Each lesson can contain multiple topics (facts, concepts, processes, procedures, principles)
4. Intuitive lesson builder interface showing project overview with expandable lesson list
5. Drag-and-drop lesson reordering within projects for logical sequencing
6. Lesson status tracking independent of project status (draft, in-progress, completed, reviewed)
7. Project dashboard showing lesson count, completion status, and overall progress
8. Easy navigation between project view and individual lesson editing
9. Bulk operations (duplicate lesson, move lesson between projects, archive completed lessons)
10. Search and filter functionality across both projects and individual lessons

## Story 1.5: Bulk Lesson Reordering - Brownfield Addition

As an instructional designer,
I want to reorder multiple lessons simultaneously within a project using drag-and-drop functionality,
so that I can efficiently organize complex training programs without individual lesson management overhead.

**Story Context:**
- **Existing System Integration:** Integrates with project management interface (Story 1.4) and lesson management structure
- **Technology:** React/TypeScript frontend with drag-and-drop library, Node.js API endpoints, PostgreSQL lesson ordering
- **Follows Pattern:** Existing single lesson drag-and-drop pattern from Story 1.4, Acceptance Criteria #5
- **Touch Points:** Project dashboard, lesson management interface, database lesson sequence storage

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Multi-select interface allows selection of multiple lessons within project view
2. Drag-and-drop reordering works with selected lesson groups, maintaining relative order within selection
3. Bulk reordering API endpoint updates lesson sequence numbers efficiently in single database transaction
4. Existing single lesson reordering continues to work unchanged
5. New functionality follows existing drag-and-drop pattern from Story 1.4
6. Integration with project dashboard maintains current lesson count and status display behavior
7. Change is covered by unit tests for API endpoints and integration tests for UI components
8. Documentation is updated in user guide for bulk operations section
9. No regression in existing single lesson reordering functionality verified

**Technical Notes:**
- **Integration Approach:** Extends existing drag-and-drop infrastructure with multi-select capability, reuses lesson ordering API with batch update support
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Story 1.4, Acceptance Criteria #5 - "Drag-and-drop lesson reordering within projects for logical sequencing"
- **Key Constraints:** Must maintain database consistency during bulk updates, preserve lesson status and metadata during reordering
